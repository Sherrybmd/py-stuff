Big mistake many do and regret later:

    jumping right into coding and solving problems, WITHOUT thinking about it beforehand.


Why does it matter?

    the core concept of programming is to solve problems, how can you solve a problem
    when you don't even understand the problem? how can you give the solution to a machine
    when you don't have it in your head?
